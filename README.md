# Swing Java Calculator

This repository contains a basic calculator application built using Java Swing. The application provides three different calculators: a Simple Calculator, a BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator, and a Quadratic Equation Solver.

## Features

1. **Simple Calculator:** Allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2. **BMI Calculator:** Helps users calculate their Body Mass Index by entering their height and weight. It provides a classification of the calculated BMI value as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.
3. **Quadratic Equation Solver:** Enables users to solve quadratic equations of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0 by inputting the coefficients (a, b, and c). It provides the real roots of the equation if they exist.

## Technologies Used

- Java Swing: Used to create the graphical user interface (GUI) for the calculator application.
- Java AWT: Utilized for additional UI components and event handling.
- Java Math Library: Employed for mathematical calculations in the BMI Calculator and Quadratic Equation Solver.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Compile and run the `CalculatorApp.java` file.
4. Choose one of the three calculator options from the menu.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to input the required values and perform calculations.
